## How we work

150$ compensation paid upfront
mack get computer and do 6 tasks

1. No strict deadline, take the times it need for you to learn. Should take between one and two weeks to do all this work.
2. IMPORTANT! Everyday that you work, at the end of the day you go in the [Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/815011042022522921/849440708834230303) and you write what you did AND what you are blocked on. Is important so that other people can help you and you can move faster.
3. If you are blocked on one task, and no one is there to help, start working on another task.  If you spend more than 1 hour trying to do something and you can't, just move on to another tasks, and wait for someone to come to help you.

How to ask for help
1. Ask question in the [discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/815011042022522921/849440708834230303), lessand.ro or siddart should reply you in 24h.
2. Ask on stackoverflow, is important to ask questions in a good way, for example like this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55131398/matplotlib-scatter-the-more-overlapping-points-the-bigger-the-marker
3. look for reddit or other slack/discord with people who know about android and ask there
4. try to rewatch alex stream to see how he did things (e.g. android studio)
